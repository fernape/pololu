Playing with Pololu 3pi

## What is this about?
This is a repo to upload some of the code I wrote for the pololu 3pi.
You can think of the pololu as an Arduino with wheels. It has an Atmega 168
microcontroller and enough I/O pins to play with them.

It was originally created as a line follower robot and it features several
reflectance sensors for that purpose.
